Python is a low level programming language widely used in AI/ML field. 
I'm learning python so that I can dive into the field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

# Variable and Data Types

A variable is used to store some data (value).
Data can be of different types like int, string, float/decimal or char. These are known as data types. For example all the integer numbers like 5,68,11,6451,etc. are of int data type, all the english alphabet letters(a,b,M,N,etc.) are of char data type, words like "hello", "python" or anything written within inverted quotes are of string data type and decimal numbers like 1.5, 346.15665, etc. are of decimal/float data type.

# Control Flow (Decision Making)

Control flow means the order in which statements in a program are executed.
in a real program, we often need to make decisions on the basis of some conditions, if a condition is true we execute the statement else we execute different statement.
This decision making ability is called control flow.

Imagine a real life situation: 
If it's raining -> take umbrella.
if it's not raining -> don't take umbrella.
python works the same way.
* Input is taken
* Condition is checked
* Action is performed based on the result
