# Variable and Data Types

A variable is used to store data (some value).
Data can be of different types like int, string, float/decimal or char. These are known as data types. For example all the integer numbers like 5,68,11,6451,etc. are of int data type, all the english alphabet letters(a,b,M,N,etc.) are of char data type, words like "hello", "python" or anything written within inverted quotes are of string data type and decimal numbers like 1.5, 346.15665, etc. are of decimal/float data type.
