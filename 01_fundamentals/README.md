Python is a high level programming language uses simple syntax, manages memory automatically(uses garbage collector) and focuses on programmer productivity.  
It is widely used in AI/ML Engineering field.   
I'm learning python so that I can dive into the field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

# Variable and Data Types

A variable is used to store some data (value).  
Data can be of different types like int, string, float/decimal or char. These are known as data types. For example all the integer numbers like 5,68,11,6451,etc. are of int data type, all the english alphabet letters(a,b,M,N,etc.) are of char data type, words like "hello", "python" or anything written within inverted quotes are of string data type and decimal numbers like 1.5, 346.15665, etc. are of decimal/float data type.

# Control Flow (Decision Making)

Control flow means the order in which statements in a program are executed.
in a real program, we often need to make decisions on the basis of some conditions, if a condition is true we execute the statement else we execute different statement.  This decision making ability is called control flow.

Imagine a real life situation:   
If it's raining -> take umbrella.  
else (if it's not raining) -> don't take umbrella.  
python works the same way.
* Input is taken
* Condition is checked
* Action is performed based on the result

 # Loops (Repetition in Programs) 

In programming, repitition means executing any statement/instruction or set of statements repeatedly until some conditions have been met.  
A loop is a way for a program to repeat a set of instructions multiple time automatically instead of writing the same code again and again.  
Real life examples:  
printing numbers from 1 to 1000.  
processing marks of every student in a class.

# Functions & Modular Thinking

A function is like a mini program inside our program, it is a block of code that performs a specific task.  
It is useful as we write a block of code once and use it many times by simply calling the function by its name defined by us avoiding repeating code multiple times.  
Example:  
Imagine we have to calculate sum, difference or mod of any two numbers instead of performing the calculations every time, we can make functions:  
def sum(x,y):  
    //code for sum  

def diff(x,y):  
     //code for difference

def mod(x,y):  
    //code for mod
