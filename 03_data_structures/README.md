# Lists in Python

* A list is a data structure used to store multiple values of similar or different data types in a single variable 
* Values in a list are sorted in a specific order  
* Lists are useful when we need to work with collections of data instead of single values
* We can iterate through every element of a list by using a loop

Real-world examples:  
* Storing marks of students
* Keeping track of user attempts
* Holding dataset values in data science and machine learning

# Strings in Pythons

* A string is a sequence of characters
* Strings are mainly used to store text and user input
* Strings are widely used in displaying messages, names, passwords, and commands
Important:
* Even numbers entered by users are treated as strings unless converted
* This is why programs may fail if input is not handled properly

 # Why User Input Causes Errors

 * Programs expect input in a specific format/data type (like numbers)
 * Users may enter unexpected values such as letters or symbols
 * When a program tries to use incorrect input, it may crash
 Solution:
 * Programs must validate input
 * Error handling mechanisms are used to prevent crashes
